#We highly recommend you read over that blog post in detail if you are stuck at any of these steps 
#First, you must get your ChatGPT API key from here: https://platform.openai.com/overview 

#Set WD 
setwd("/Users/steverathje/Desktop/GBT")

#Then, put your API key in the quotes below: 
my_API <- "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"

###More on these performance metrics here: https://towardsdatascience.com/accuracy-precision-recall-or-f1-331fb37c5cb9

#Compute Accuracy

#Run functions and compute average recall and F1
res_pos_AR <- metrics(data,1)
res_neu_AR <- metrics(data,2)
res_neg_AR <- metrics(data,3)

#Compute Average Recall
avg_rec_AR <- mean(c(res_pos_AR[2],res_neu_AR[2],res_neg_AR[2]))
avg_rec_AR

#Compute Average F1
avg_f1_AR <- mean(c(res_pos_AR[3],res_neg_AR[3]))

#What about different prompts?

  In other words, we would like to know how much emotional intensity the picture creates; 
  whether the picture captures something good or bad doesnâ€™t matter. 
  We are interested only in the degree of excitement, energy, or intensity of feeling it represents.
  Use the higher side of the scale to mark your answer if the picture represents something that is strongly emotional. 
  The words that we might use to describe the emotional state that the picture creates are aroused, alert, activated, charged, or energized.
  Use the lower side of the scale to mark your answer if the picture represents something that is not strongly emotional. 
  The words that we might use to describe the emotional state that the picture creates are unaroused, slow, still, de-energized, calm, or peaceful.
  Use the middle of the scale to indicate an image that is moderately arousing or halfway through the two extremes.
  Please use the full range of the scale to make your responses rather than relying on only a few points.
  On a scale of 1-7, what is the arousal level of this photo?
  1 = very low
  2 = moderately low
  3 = somewhat low
